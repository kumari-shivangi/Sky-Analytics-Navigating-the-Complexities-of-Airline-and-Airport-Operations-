# ✈️ Sky Analytics: Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a comprehensive case study on **aviation analytics** using three datasets: `flights.csv`, `airlines.csv`, and `airports.csv`.  
The goal is to uncover insights into **flight delays, cancellations, airline efficiency, airport traffic, and connectivity**. The analysis is performed in **Excel** with advanced functions, pivot tables, and visualizations, culminating in an **interactive dashboard**.

## 📂 Datasets  
1. **Flights Dataset (`flights.csv`)**  
   - Includes detailed flight information: schedules, delays, cancellations, air time, and distances.  

2. **Airlines Dataset (`airlines.csv`)**  
   - Contains airline codes and full airline names.  

3. **Airports Dataset (`airports.csv`)**  
   - Provides airport codes, names, locations (city/state/country), and geographic coordinates.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze **flight delays** and identify top delayed airlines.  
- Measure **airport traffic** and busiest hubs.  
- Examine **flight cancellations** and reasons.  
- Identify **seasonal and weekly patterns** in flight operations.  
- Compare **scheduled vs. actual flight durations**.  
- Evaluate **airline fleet utilization** using tail numbers.  
- Study **delay causes** (airline, weather, late aircraft, etc.).  
- Build an **interactive Excel dashboard** to explore key metrics.

## 🛠️ Part 1: Excel Data Analysis  
Key tasks performed in Excel:  
- Handling **missing values**.  
- Calculating **average delays per airline**.  
- Identifying **busiest airports** by traffic volume.  
- Analyzing **seasonal & weekly trends**.  
- Investigating **correlation between distance and delays**.  
- Ranking airlines by **on-time performance**.  
- Studying **flight duration accuracy**.  
- Exploring **hub connectivity** using unique destinations.  
- Summarizing operational metrics with **pivot tables**.  

---

## 📊 Part 2: Excel Dashboard  
The **interactive dashboard** provides:  
- **Flight operations overview** (total flights, delays, cancellations).  
- **Airline performance analysis** (delay rates, cancellations, frequency).  
- **Airport traffic visualization** (top airports with map view).  
- **Delay cause breakdown** (weather, airline, late aircraft, security).  
- **Time-based flight trends** (by day, month, time slots).  
- **User-friendly filters** (slicers, dropdowns, timelines).
